Work in progress.

Gatsby Manor has a wide range of themes in the theme gallery to use in our [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
project. However there might be a time when we feel no theme matches the
vision we have for our next project. The good news is that if we do not find a theme
we like, we can create a new theme.

## Getting started
Developing a theme is simple. Start a new project then work out
of the `themes/starter` directory. If you need to interact with the gatsby `API`
then modify `jay-config.js, jay-node.js, jay-ssr.js or jay-browser.js`. Then make
sure to export those functions in the top level `gatsby-config.js, gatsby-node.js, gatsby-ssr.js or gatsby-browser.js` files.
