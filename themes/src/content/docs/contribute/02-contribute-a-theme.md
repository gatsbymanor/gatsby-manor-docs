Work in progress.

We welcome all opportunities to contribute a theme to the Gatsby Manor. If you
do not have a theme ready to contribute, read our theme development
[tutorial](/docs/tutorials/theme-development) to get a theme ready for
contribution. In this article we are going to create a pull request for a theme.
