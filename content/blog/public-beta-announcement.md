TL;DR: Gatsby Manor is a place to get themes for your GatsbyJS
project. Use our [getting started](/docs/quick-start/getting-started)
tutorial to use a Gatsby Manor theme in your GatsbyJS project today!

## Overview
I am proud to announce Gatsby Manor, a gallery of themes for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
After 5 months of development, Gatsby Manor is now in public beta. If you are not
familiar with GatsbyJS, use their [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)
to experience the delight of working with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
static site generator. When you are done learning, use one of
our [themes](/themes) to kickstart your GatsbyJS project.

## Core Concepts
Gatsby Manor is built on top of GatsbyJS to provide a painless way of building
a websites with reusable ReactJS components we call themes. We even have a
cleverly named npm module for theme management called [Jay](https://github.com/gatsbymanor/gatsby-jay)
ðŸ˜„.

With Jay you can download a theme from our collection, and mount it as a
default theme. Styles are applied instantly without server restarts or
additional lines of code. Because of ReactJS, interactivity is supported out
of the box.

Want to switch themes? No problem. Jay can archive themes for later use in
a themes folder in your local directory. Edit and swap themes as often as you
want and Jay will manage the process.

## How it all started
The idea began when I decided to update my personal website. I wanted a way
to rebuild my website with ease however the approaches were less than
exciting.

Building a new site myself would require a lot of time. My imagination often
runs wild when it comes to web design and what is supposed to be a day worth
of work turns into weeks of site iterations. The joys of web development often
causes me to over-engineer simple websites. Not to mention that building a development environment
alone is the biggest requirement when starting from scratch. Therefore another option
needed to be explored.

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) would be the fastest solution to build a website but I wanted to be
able to rapidly prototype on customs themes. Understanding the
architecture to develop themes on this stack would require additional time. Not to
mention I dislike PHP (#sorryNotSorry ðŸ˜…) therefore this option was a clear loser.
I tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). They gave me the right mix of speed and control. Their
templating languages were unappealing as long term options.

When I stumbled onto GatsbyJS, I found the golden goose. I already worked
with ReactJS before, therefore I could prototype rapidly. The development
environment gave me a tight feedback loop out of the box. And I had all the
control in the world for enhanced interactive features.

Once I settled on Gatsby I started working on my personal website.
Within 2 hours I knew I wanted to iterate on different design elements
without having to throw away what I had previously worked on.
In order to solve my problem of having different site themes, I started to
build a theme management platform for my components. Five months later Gatsby
Manor was born.

## Final notes
Gatsby Manor is in public beta until we reach v1. There are plenty of
[Github]() contributions to go around. To get started, try out a Gatsby Manor theme using
our tutorial on [getting started](/docs/quick-start/getting-started). Open
an issue if you see an area of improvement. Send us positive vibes on Twitter
using [@TheGatsbyManor](https://twitter.com/TheGatsbyManor).

Cheers! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
